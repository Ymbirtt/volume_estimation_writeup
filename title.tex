\begin{abstract}
We evaluate a practical implementation of an efficient convex volume estimation algorithm, and tune its parameters such that they produce accurate results, with fewer computational steps than those deemed necessary in the theoretical papers. We find that $2^5$ steps of a hit and run random walk is sufficient to produce adequately random points and $2^{13}$ random points is enough to provide reasonable quality estimates of volume ratios. We then conclude by showing that for a convex polytope in 10 or more dimensions with 25 or more vertices, it is more efficient to use a randomised algorithm than to compute the volume exactly.
